# Structural Similarity Index
### Description
This is an implementation of a Structural Similarity Index algorithm in C#. It is a very useful algorithm for meaningfully comparing two images in various ways.

### Purpose
This repo is for anyone who wants an example on how to implement a Structural Similarity Index algorithm in C#.

### Note
This particular implementation is not very well optimized, so I encourage you, the reader, to try and optimize it yourself!
